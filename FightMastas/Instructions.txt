                               WELCOME TO BATTLE 4 BEERS
                          (press enter to go back to game menu)

THIS GAME IS PROBABLY (not) THE BEST WAY FOR TWO BEER LOVERS
TO DECIDE WHICH ONE SHOULD BUY BEERS FOR THE TWO PLAYERS.

THIS IS A BATTLE-BASED GAME WHERE EACH PLAYER CAN SELECT
A DIFFERENT TYPE OF HERO AND BATTLE HIS OPPONENT'S HERO.

THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF HEROES:
--- WARRIOR
--- MAGE

BOTH TYPES OF HEROES HAVE 3 DIFFERENT CLASSES:
WARRIOR:
---SWORDMASTER
---BERSERKER
---PROTECTOR

MAGE:
---FIRE MAGE
---ARCANE MAGE
---FROST MAGE

THERE ARE SOME THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW BEFORE SELECTING A HERO
AND HIS CLASS:

1. SWORDMASTERS CAN LEVEL UP A 35% CRITICAL CHANCE ON ALL OF THEIR
ACTIONS FOR DOUBLE DAMAGE UNTILL THE END OF THE GAME,
THIS MAKES THEM LOSE 1 TURN.

2. BERSERKERS HAVE THE ABILITY TO SACRIFICE 300 HEALTH POINTS 1 ROUND,
TO GAIN DOUBLE DAMAGE FOR 3 ROUNDS.

3. BERSERKERS HAVE A PASSIVE 15% CRITICAL CHANCE FOR DOUBLE DAMAGE.
YES, IF THIS 15% CRITICAL CHANCE OCCURS DURING BERSERKER MODE,
THE DAMAGE IS QUADRUPLED INSTEAD OF DOUBLED.

4. BERSERKERS HAVE THE ABILITY TO EXECUTE(KILL) THE ENEMY IF HIS HP IS BELOW 700.

5. PROTECTORS START THEIR GAME WITH A BONUS OF 300 ARMOR.

6. FIRE MAGES HAVE THE ABILITY TO INCINERATE(KILL) THE ENEMY IF HIS HP IS BELOW 900.

7. ARCANE MAGES HAVE THE ABILITY TO AMPLIFY THEIR SPELL POWER, WHICH DOUBLES THE
DAMAGE OF THEIR ARCANE BLAST SPELL.

8. FROST MAGES CAN USE ICY VEINS WHICH LOWERS THE COOLDOWN OF ALL OTHER SPELLS BY 1 POINT.

9. FROST MAGES CAN USE FROST ARMOR OR FROST BOLT TO EITHER GAIN ARMOR OR DAMAGE THE OPPONENT
AND GAIN A 20% PHYSICAL DAMAGE REDUCTION AGAINST ALL KINDS OF WARRIORS.
