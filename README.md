Imagine the situation:

It's night-time and you're already tired of working...
You just wanna have a beer with a friend...
Your friend feels the same way though, but neither of you want to spend any money...

THIS IS WHERE BATTLE 4 BEERS COMES IN HAND!!!

This console-based game is developped to help people make such HARD decisions!

In B4B each players selects a hero and a class for that hero.
*Note that every hero and his class have different spells and actions*

Then they battle TO THE DEATH!

And in order to keep track of all the beers each winner has earned - an Earned beers option in the game menu was developed.
There you can type in the Name you've used for your character and get a list of all the beers you've earned!

In case you want to check out more about the hero types and classes you can select the Instructions option in the game menu.

*DISCLAIMER*
B4B AND ITS CREATORS ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY MONEY LOSS, THEFT OR VIOLENCE.

The game was developed all by myself: Ivaylo Ivanov :)
